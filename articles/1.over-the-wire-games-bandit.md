### Bandit
Bandit is something that I have experienced, it is super fun to play and provides
a lot of scope to learn about things, especially in networking
* You start the game by logging into an SSH port
* The website will provide you hints and details at each level
* There are about ~30 levels to choose from 
* The passkeys and passwords are always stored in the previous level
* There is no time limit

#### Bandit Level 0 -> 1
